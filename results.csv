Sometimes you don't realize how you actually feel until you're finally alone and no one is around to tell you how you should.
RT @janoahboo: Sometimes it's nice to just sit in bed while listening to music and just let yourself reflect on things for a bit.
The people that talk about how our school has so many problems and then makes fun of any effort to change things :expressionless_face:

You spend so much time being "okay" &amp; "fine" everyday that sometimes it just feels good to be alone &amp; admit to yourself that you're not.
Nothing makes me realize who and what matters the most to me like looking back and seeing who has been with me no matter what through it all
Do you ever just have those random moments of reflection were you think about how much your life has changed since this moment a year ago?
